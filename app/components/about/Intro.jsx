For over a decade, our non-profit institution has brought together students from across the globe to study in the hallowed halls of the University of Oxford. Our program is accredited by the <span className="text-orange font-semibold">British Accreditation Council (BAC)</span> as a short and further education provider, ensuring that students receive a high standard of learning and support.

                <p className="text-base text-black mx-auto">
                    While OSI is not an official part of the University of Oxford, we proudly partner with its constituent colleges and departments to give our students unparalleled access to the Oxford experience. All of our tutors, lecturers, deans, and other staff members are associated with the University of Oxford, providing students with the opportunity to learn from current and former Oxford academics.

                    Our program is designed to inspire the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and innovators by combining rigorous academics with enriching extracurricular activities. At OSI, students aged 15 to 25 will have the chance to explore subjects ranging from STEM to the humanities, all while experiencing the traditions, values, and spirit of this historic institution.
